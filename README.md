dev: UnknwnSaber

General Information
a port is a communication endpoint for a specific process or service. Ports are identified by a number, ranging from 0 to 65535. Common ports include:

21: FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
22: SSH (Secure Shell)
80: HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
443: HTTPS (HTTP Secure)

These ports allow different services to run simultaneously on a single IP address. A port scanner helps identify which ports are open and what services are running on them.
